# 1. Register the AWS Free Account

To register an AWS account, you need to submit a valid phone number and a bank card (Visa or Mastercard). I recommend using virtual cards provided for free by [Yandex.Money](https://money.yandex.ru/cards/virtual) or [Qiwi](https://qiwi.com/cards/qvc) wallet. 
AWS checks the validity of the card by deducting 1$ at registration followed by the refund.

## 1.1. Opening the AWS Management Console
Follow the link: [https://aws.amazon.com/](https://aws.amazon.com/en/), click on the **Create an AWS account** button.

## 1.5. Account Verification
AWS verifies your phone number and debits $ 1 from your bank card. Then you should get a 4-digit code on the computer screen and receive a call from Amazon. During a call, you need to dial the 4-digit code shown on the screen.

#### 1.8.1. Internet speed testing
I recommended you to run a speed test to the nearest Datacenters at [https://speedtest.net/](https://speedtest.net/) and choose the best to connect to.  
 
The following are the speed test results from my location: 
* Singapore

* London

The Datacenter in London shows the best speed result, so I choose it to proceed with.
