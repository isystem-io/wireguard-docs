# 4. Configure Wireguard server
Below is the instruction for a script-driven Wireguard installation and management.
I keep the latest version of the instruction in the repository: [https://github.com/isystem-io/wireguard-aws](https://github.com/isystem-io/wireguard-aws)

## 4.1. Install Wireguard
Enter the following commands in the Putty terminal.
You can copy them to the clipboard, and paste in the terminal by pressing the right mouse button.

### 4.1.1. Clone the scripts repository
Clone a Wireguard installation scripts repository: 
```
git clone https://github.com/pprometey/wireguard_aws.git wireguard_aws
```

### 4.1.2. Directory of scripts repository
Go to the directory of the cloned repository:
```
cd wireguard_aws
```

### 4.1.3 Initialization script
Run the Wireguard installation script under admin (root user) rights:
```
sudo ./initial.sh
```
The script asks you to provide the following data to configure Wireguard.

#### 4.1.3.1. Set connection endpoint (IP:port)
Enter the external IP address (see [2.2.3](#_2-2-3-ip-address-overview)) and the open port (see [2.1.5](#_2-1-5-opening-ports-configuring-a-firewall)) of the Wireguard server. Use the following format ***IP:port***, for example, `4.3.2.1:54321`. Press Enter key to confirm.
```
Enter the endpoint (external ip and port) in format[ipv4:port] (e.g. 4.3.2.1:54321): 4.3.2.1:54321
```

#### 4.1.3.2. Set internal IP address
Enter the IP address of the Wireguard server in a secure VPN subnet. If you do not know what it is, press Enter key to set the default value (`10.50.0.1`).
```
Enter the server address in the VPN subnet (CIDR format) ([ENTER] set to default: 10.50.0.1):
```

#### 4.1.3.3. Specify DNS Server
Enter the IP address of the DNS server, or press Enter key to set the default value `1.1.1.1` (Cloudflare public DNS).
```
Enter the ip address of the server DNS (CIDR format) ([ENTER] set to default: 1.1.1.1):
```

#### 4.1.3.4. Specify WAN Interface
Enter the name of the external network interface. This interface will sense the internal network interface of the VPN. 
Press Enter to set the default for AWS (`eth0`)
```
Enter the name of the WAN network interface ([ENTER] set to default: eth0):
```

#### 4.1.3.5. Specify customer name
The Wireguard VPN server cannot start until you add at least one client. Enter a VPN username.
In my case, I entered Alex@mobil name.
```
Enter VPN user name: Alex@mobile
```
After that, you should receive a QR code of an added client configuration. This QR applies the user config to Wireguard mobile client on Android or iOS. 
The text of the configuration file is also displayed with QR. You will need in case of manual configuration of clients as discussed below.

## 4.2. Add new VPN user
To add a new user, you need to run the script `add-client.sh` in the terminal
```
sudo ./add-client.sh
```
The script asks for the username:
```
Enter VPN user name:
```
The username can go along as a script parameter (in my case, the username is Alex@mobile): 
```
sudo ./add-client.sh Alex@mobile
```
The execution of the script leads to the creation of the client config file in the client directory.
Client config file: `/etc/wireguard/clients/{ClientName}/{ClientName}.conf `. 
Client directory: 
`/etc/wireguard/clients/{ClientName}`

### 4.2.1. User configuration file
Execute the cat command to get the contents of the `.conf` file for client manual configuration.
```
sudo cat/etc/wireguard/clients/Alex@mobile/Alex@mobile.conf
```
the result of command execution as follows:
```
[Interface]
PrivateKey = oDMWr0toPVCvgKt5oncLLRfHRit + jbzT5cshNUi8zlM =
Address = 10.50.0.2/32
DNS = 1.1.1.1

[Peer]
PublicKey = mLnd + mul15U0EP6jCH5MRhIAjsfKYuIU / j5ml8Z2SEk =
PresharedKey = wjXdcf8CG29Scmnl5D97N46PhVn1jecioaXjdvrEkAc =
AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0, :: / 0
Endpoint = 4.3.2.1:54321
```
description of client configuration file:
```
[Interface]
PrivateKey = Client's private key
Address = Client IP Address
DNS = DNS used by the client

[Peer]
PublicKey = Public key server
PresharedKey = Shared server and client key
AllowedIPs = Allowed addresses for connection (all - 0.0.0.0/0, :: / 0)
Endpoint = IP address and port for connection
```

### 4.2.2. Client configuration with QR code
Execute the `qrencode -t ansiutf8` command to get the QR of a created client config. (in my case, the new client name is Alex@mobile).
```
sudo cat /etc/wireguard/clients/Alex@mobile/Alex@mobile.conf | qrencode -t ansiutf8
```
