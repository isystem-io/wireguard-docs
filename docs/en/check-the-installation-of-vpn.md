# 6. Verify VPN connection
Use [https://2ip.ua/en/](https://2ip.ua/en/) resource to verify the VPN tunnel connection. If the displayed IP address matches the one we got in [2.2.3](create-aws-instance.html#_2-2-3-ip-address-overview), so the VPN tunnel is up and running.

In a Linux terminal, you can check your IP address by executing the following command:
```
curl http://zx2c4.com/ip
```
